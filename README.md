### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently a Client Support Coordinator I am able assist individuals with their every day tasks in other to improve their quality of life.

I decided to explore further into one of interest, in coding, and took a chance to learn all the required skills at Bloom Tech. I enjoy the experience of creating something from scratch and finding solutions to complex problems

Learning new skills every week has been challenging, as well as rewarding. I'm looking forward to a day were I could apply my skills.
