### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I work as a Client Support Coordinator, where I am able to assist individuals with their everyday tasks, which can help improve their quality of life.

Last year, I decided to explore a long-time interest of mine (coding), and ultimately took a chance to learn all the required skills at Bloom Tech. I enjoy the experience of creating something from scratch, and finding solutions to complex problems.

Learning new skills every week has been challenging, exciting, and rewarding. I'm looking forward to a day were I can apply my skills in this diverse field.

Technical Skills
 
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Hooks, Axios, Context API, Cypress, Node.js, sqlite3, Express
